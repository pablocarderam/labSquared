# **lab<sup>2</sup>** is an imaginary lab handbook.

### **lab<sup>2</sup>** (labSquared) a science manifesto, a thought-experiment on doing experiments, an exercise exploring possible futures for science and research.

It is run by [Pablo Cárdenas](https://pablocarderam.github.io/), a grad student at [MIT Biological Engineering](https://be.mit.edu/) at time of writing.

*Why does a grad student make a fake lab website?*

- because scientists themselves are increasingly voicing and listening to critiques about the way science works, and the time is ripe to join the conversation
- because many of the problems identified can be solved by listening more closely to science trainees (and a broader audience in general)
- because not being in a head-of-lab position gives freedom to experiment without compromise
- because if trainees wait to be in a position where we can run our own labs, we may never get the chance to contribute our thoughts
- because this can be a reminder to myself and others, if we do end up running anything in the future

A print-friendly format of **lab<sup>2</sup>** is available [here](full.md) (thanks, [mkdocs-combine](https://twardoch.github.io/mkdocs-combine/)!).
