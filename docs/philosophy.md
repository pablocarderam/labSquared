## Lessons from biology

I am a biologist

Structure inspired by scales on biology, in part aesthetically pleasing, in part underlying wisdom.

Nothing makes sense if not in the light of evolution.

As any lab, **lab<sup>2</sup>** is continuously evolving. This evolution is tracked on a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pablocarderam/labSquared/), as the content is written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). Whether you do or don't run a lab, **you are encouraged to fork it, re-hash it, copy pieces or be inspired by any part of it**.

## Mission

Hypothetical academic lab. Objective: reproduction. Not interpreted as creating new labs, but creating new scientists. Research in function of this.
