# **lab<sup>2</sup>** is an imaginary lab handbook.

### **lab<sup>2</sup>** (labSquared) a science manifesto, a thought-experiment on doing experiments, an exercise exploring possible futures for science and research.

It is run by [Pablo Cárdenas](https://pablocarderam.github.io/), a grad student at [MIT Biological Engineering](https://be.mit.edu/) at time of writing.

*Why does a grad student make a fake lab website?*

- because scientists themselves are increasingly voicing and listening to critiques about the way science works, and the time is ripe to join the conversation
- because many of the problems identified can be solved by listening more closely to science trainees (and a broader audience in general)
- because not being in a head-of-lab position gives freedom to experiment without compromise
- because if trainees wait to be in a position where we can run our own labs, we may never get the chance to contribute our thoughts
- because this can be a reminder to myself and others, if we do end up running anything in the future

A print-friendly format of **lab<sup>2</sup>** is availablehere (thanks, [mkdocs-combine](https://twardoch.github.io/mkdocs-combine/)!).

## Lessons from biology

I am a biologist

Structure inspired by scales on biology, in part aesthetically pleasing, in part underlying wisdom.

Nothing makes sense if not in the light of evolution.

As any lab, **lab<sup>2</sup>** is continuously evolving. This evolution is tracked on a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pablocarderam/labSquared/), as the content is written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). Whether you do or don't run a lab, **you are encouraged to fork it, re-hash it, copy pieces or be inspired by any part of it**.

## Mission

Hypothetical academic lab. Objective: reproduction. Not interpreted as creating new labs, but creating new scientists. Research in function of this.
