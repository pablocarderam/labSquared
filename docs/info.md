## Additional Materials

### Reason
- Multiple studies across the past years have pointed to the stress scientists, particularly trainees, work under, as surveyed by [Evans et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.4089), [biennial surveys by _Nature_](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03489-1) or [this Wellcome Trust survey](https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/what-researchers-think-about-the-culture-they-work-in.pdf).
- It is widely documented that the number of faculty applicants far exceeds the posts available, [as Larson et al. explore mathematically here](https://doi.org/10.1002/sres.2210). Naturally, alternative career paths can lead to leading a lab as well, but the level of industrial development needed for those paths is not available for all fields of science or countries, necessarily.

### Philosophy
- Traditionally, modern science is thought to have arisen during the XVI–XVII century period known as the Scientific Revolution. [Excellent critiques of this view have been made](https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/S/bo29143181.html), but there is little question that the individual scale at which science was practiced then is far removed from the armies in lab coats that characterize [science since World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Science).
- Dobzhansky first made his famous assertion in [an essay calling for the importance of organismic biology at the height of the 1960s molecular biology craze](https://doi.org/10.1093%2Ficb%2F4.4.443).

### Composition
- C.R. Darwin's [Origin of The Species](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1228) (1859) already underscores the importance of variation.
- Business researchers at [Harvard](https://hbr.org/2017/03/teams-solve-problems-faster-when-theyre-more-cognitively-diverse) and [Boston Consulting](https://www.bcg.com/en-us/publications/2018/how-diverse-leadership-teams-boost-innovation.aspx), among others, have established the advantages of diverse teams in problem solving and overall company performance.
- J.L. Wood (2019) outlines [four strategies for diversity in recruitment practices](https://diverseeducation.com/article/149878/): implicit bias training, certification of applicant pools, having diversity advocates on committees, and adopting inclusive job search criteria.
- B. Latour famously pioneered laboratory ethnographies in his 1973 book _[Laboratory Life: The Construction of Scientific Facts](https://doi.org/10.2307/j.ctt32bbxc)_.
- G. Bennett and P. Rabinow repeated a similar exercise as part of the Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center, chronicled in 2009's [Designing Human Practices](https://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/D/bo12986260.html).
- [Fermilab hosts artists-in-residence](https://events.fnal.gov/art-gallery/artist-in-residence/), as do many other scientific institutes.
- Nature runs a PhD survey every year with [worrying results regarding advisor-advisee relationships](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03489-1).
- Many people understandably argue in favor of [cutting down on meetings](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03953-y).

### Metabolism

- [Open Notebook Science as a movement](https://openlabnotebooks.org/) has been around for some time as a small community
- Jean-Claude Bradley laid down the ideas for open-notebook science [in this 2006 blog post](http://drexel-coas-elearning.blogspot.com/2006/09/open-notebook-science.html).
- Openlabnotebooks.org have collected [a number of resources on the subject](https://openlabnotebooks.org/about/)
- [**lab2web**](https://github.com/lab-squared/lab2web) is a (somewhat crude) interactive mental map scheme made for this work, available as open source on GitHub.
- [Open Knowledge Maps](https://openknowledgemaps.org/index) is a non-profit that builds visual representations of information and research.
- [Fraser et al. (2019)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/673665v1) and [Abdil & Blekhman (2019)](https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.45133) examine the success of preprinting on biorXiv.
- Popular reprint repositories include [arXiv](https://www.arxiv.org/), [biorXiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/), [medrXiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/), and [psyArXiv](https://www.psyArXiv.com/).
- ASAPbio, Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), and Wellcome held a meeting on “Transparency, Recognition, and Innovation in Peer Review in the Life Sciences” on February 7-9, 2018. Archives of the meeting can be found [here](https://asapbio.org/peer-review).
- [Tennant et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.3390/publications7020034) briefly review some of the most common questions surrounding preprints, open access, and scholarly publishing.
- [Wellcome Open Research](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/about) is a journal run by the Wellcome Trust operating by immediate publication and post-publication, invited, open peer review.
- Resources for navigating Science Twitter are being published on journals such as this piece by [Heemstra (2019)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.9b01273).
- [ResearchHub](https://researchnow.researchhub.com/), [Knowledgr](https://www.knowledgr.io/), and [Qeios](https://www.qeios.com/) are all open science platforms exploring what an online, collaborative science framework can be like. [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/) is a slightly more established, if more traditional, social network for scientists.

### Growth
- [Lambert et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.48774) survey women and underrepresented minority postdocs in the life sciences considering academia as a career path, finding they would value clearer mentorship outside the lab as well as more training in transitioning to research independence, teaching, and community-based research, among others.
- [Feldon et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1912488116) find senior lab member mentorship, not direct PI mentorship, is the most important factor determining future career success for a cohort of bioscience PhD students in the US over 4 years.
- Indeed, the literature on teaching and pedagogy is far too vast to review. In *[What the Best College Teachers Do](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674013254)*, K. Bain (2004) reviews observations of over 100 college professors, which he summarizes in [this 2015 interview](https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2015/05/08/404960905/what-the-best-college-teachers-do). P. Freire's 1968 [Pedagogy of the Oppressed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedagogy_of_the_Oppressed) is a seminal work in pedagogy.
- [The MIT BE Comm Lab](https://mitcommlab.mit.edu/) has a number of excellent online resources available to all, and there are several more initiatives like it elsewhere.
- Simine Vazire [writes an editorial calling for more regard for scientists pointing out mistakes](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-019-03909-2), particularly trainees.


### Ecology
- The donations made by convicted sexual criminal Jeffrey Epstein to MIT resulted in [an external investigation into the matter](http://factfindingjan2020.mit.edu/files/MIT-report.pdf), which found serious errors in judgement on behalf of the administration even if no laws were broken. Regardless, the episode resulted in resignations within MIT and [strong reaction from the public](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/07/jeffrey-epstein-mit-funding-tech-intellectuals).
- "[the term "general public" homogenizes a wide range of interest groups]()": I am aware I read this at some point in time before, but cannot recall where. Any references to this end would be welcome.
- Besides the ubiquity of [#SciComm on Science Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23scicomm&src=typeahead_click), a [conference on the matter](https://www.scicommsummit.com/) has been gaining traction as of late.
- Methodologies like [Community-Based Participatory Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community-based_participatory_research) or [Participatory Action Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_action_research) can involve other groups normally marginal to scientific research. The [Public Lab](https://publiclab.org) is an interesting instance of similar kinds of approaches in environmental research.
- [Lambert et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.48774), see **Growth** notes above.
