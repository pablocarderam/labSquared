# About the author

[Pablo CÃ¡rdenas](https://pablocarderam.github.io/) (he/him) is a grad student at the [Niles Lab](https://web.mit.edu/nileslab/) at [MIT Biological Engineering](https://be.mit.edu/) and a peer support Ref with the [BE REFS](berefs.com/).

 This project began based on mulling over conversations and observations gathered during an incredibly lucky three-year period spent working in research groups with specialties spanning field, theoretical, and laboratory work, with wildly different budgets, in academia and industry, strewn across five institutions in three different continents. I am grateful to all the fellow grad students, research scientists, postdocs, interns, mentors, trainees, students, professors, and random invited seminar speakers that unknowingly contributed to this work, and I  regret not being able to credit them all by name.
