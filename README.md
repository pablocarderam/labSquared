### **lab<sup>2</sup>** (labSquared) is a hypothetical lab manifesto, a thought-experiment on doing experiments, an outside-the-box exercise in imagining possible futures for science and research.

It is run by [Pablo Cárdenas](https://pablocarderam.github.io/), a grad student at [MIT Biological Engineering](https://be.mit.edu/).

*Why does a grad student make a fake lab website?*

- because scientists themselves are increasingly voicing and listening to critiques about the way science works, and the time is ripe to join the conversation
- because many of the problems identified can be solved by listening more closely to science trainees (and a broader audience in general)
- because not being in a head-of-lab position gives freedom to experiment without compromise
- because if trainees wait to be in a position where we can run our own labs, we may never get the chance to contribute our thoughts
- because I'd like to remind myself of these things if I do end up running anything in the future, so might as well remind everyone else

As any lab, **lab<sup>2</sup>** is continuously evolving. This evolution is tracked on a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pablocarderam/labSquared/), as the content is written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). Whether you do or don't run a lab, **you are encouraged to fork it, re-hash it, copy pieces or be inspired by any part of it**.

A print-friendly format of **lab<sup>2</sup>** is available [here](full.md).
